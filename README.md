- 👋 Hi, I’m @Neerka, but you can call me Jacob.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, RPGs and music. I like to "expirience" all sorts of fantasy. I mean books, films, etc. I also mean sci-fi (it's just "future" fantasy I guess). That's definitely my fav genre. My other interests are: worldbuiding, character writing, storytelling (despite I'm terrible at this one) and I try to draw, but I'm still a noob.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and I'm planning to learn C++ too. I also study cognitive science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I don't really know, just learning rn.
- 📫 How to reach me? *Might fill this gap later*
